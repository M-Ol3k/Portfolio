                <h2>Learning</h2>
                <p>Prior to this module I had experienced working with HTML and CSS. With that said, I'd quickly
                    realised that I still
                    had much to learn, as I discovered new tags and elements within both of the languages during
                    the
                    first half of the semester. I was fully aware of the fundamentals of both the languages, but my
                    interest started to peak once the more complicated selectors and animations were introduced during
                    the lectures. I have
                    a
                    tendency to do my own research on areas which catch my eye, so week by week I have been discovering
                    different ways to implement different kids of features into this portfolio.
                </p>

                <p> I have made great leaps in learning how to apply my knowledge, but my biggest downfalls stem from
                    not researching
                    into alternative designs before I start coding. While designing the main page, I
                    first implemented a 'grid' based design to the main section of the page, which ended up being so
                    complicated that i eventually lost sight of my original design. I revamped my design, scrapping 12
                    hours of coding and research in one go. However, in return I had arrived at a more comfortable
                    looking main page and some much better looking code. This was the biggest learning experience during
                    this project.
                </p>

            <div class="Experience">
                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <p>I have thoroughly enjoyed the first half of this module; I think that it has been the most enjoyable
                    module out of them all so far. Our tutor had delivered excellent lectures and demonstrations; the
                    lab sessions were very engaging and made me feel excited for the ones to follow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can honestly say that this assignment has been one of few which I've actually enjoyed. I always
                    wanted to try and make a portfolio of my own on the web, but I'd never gotten around to making one,
                    this time I had no excuse. My plan is to remaster these web pages throughout my career and use this
                    as a display of my skill during interviews etc.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="Report">
                <h2>Report</h2>
                <p>Throughout the first two or three weeks of the semester I had decided to create isolated parts of the
                    website, to later put them together into one coherent portfolio. This didn't exactly go to plan as I
                    had changed my mind on what the final product will look like many times. I really struggle to make
                    up my mind when it comes to designs, so I even created some wireframes to guide me. I later changed
                    these layouts as they didnt look good once I unlocked more advanced techniques within CSS.</p>

                <h3>Index page</h3>
                <img src="Main-page-WF.PNG" alt="Image of 'Index' page wireframe">
                <p>The main page was designed with a centered approach, which showcases all of the information in the
                    middle of the page. The logo, navigation strip and footer have been styled as simply as possible to
                    maintain a clean and professional approach. The last thing I wanted, was to make this portfolio a
                    mess to look at.</p>

                <h3>Portfolio page</h3>
                <img src="Portfolio-page-WF.PNG" alt="Image of 'Portfolio' page wireframe">
                <p> The portfolio page was initially going to feature the design above, however once it was created and
                    'live', I really didnt like the look of it and so I changed the layout to be what it is now.
                </p>

                <h3>Contact page</h3>
                <img src="Contact-page-WF.PNG" alt="Image of 'Contact' page wireframe">
                <p>The contact page started from a simple layout as I didnt really have many plans on what to put into
                    it. I had added most of the functionality after it was covered in the lectures.
                </p>


                <h3>Work experience page</h3>
                <img src="Work-exp-WF.PNG" alt="Image of 'Work experience' wireframe">
                <p>The worke experence page pretty much turned out just as I had planned it, with 3 columns showcasing
                    previous work experience.
                </p>

                    files also.</p>
